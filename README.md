# LeNet

Pytorch implementation of techniques described in Y. Lecun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio and P. Haffner, "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition," in Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278-2324, Nov. 1998, doi: 10.1109/5.726791.

We implement all the classifiers mentioned in the paper and compare their performance to LeNet-5

You can now draw your own number on an interactive webpage and see what the model thinks it is. To run

```cd LeNet5/frontend```

```npm run```

```cd LeNet5```

```streamlit run interface.py```
